A reproducible ananlysis serves as an in-depth documentation of an analysis.
Results can be recreated by others and repeated at any time.
It effectively promotes collaboration of several analysts working on the same project.
If appropriatly set up, the analysis can be redone with different parameters making follow-up analyses straightforward and painfree.
The rigor required to make an analysis reproducible increases the confidence of both analysts and clients in the obtained results.
