Get to know your customers and learn about the process of dividing a broad consumer market into sub-groups of consumers (segments) based on shared characteristics such as geography, demographic, behaviour and psychographic.


### Course syllabus

- As an introduction to this course we will present a best practice, evidence based, scientific and 
  reproducible workflow for our analysis using the statistical programming language R. 
  We will learn about R scripts and Rmarkdown documents.
- The preparation of a suitable dataset forms the basis of the actual segmentation analysis. 
  In particular we discuss how to engineer features, suitable pre-processing techniques 
  (imputation, scaling, encoding) and approaches to reduce the dimensions of our modeling dataset.
- A very informative segmentation approach is the RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) analysis. 
  It is a marketing technique used to determine quantitatively how recently customers have purchased (recency), 
  how often they purchase (frequency), and how much they spend (monetary). 
  We will learn how to split the modeling dataset into suitable RFM groups and 
  how to present the findings in tabular and chart form.
- Using clustering algorithms we demonstrate how to find natural groups of customers 
  having similar characteristics.
- Evaluating the quality of a segmentation is a critical step to obtain robust results. 
  We will explain relevant metrics and diagnostic plots to determine segmentation quality.
- Finally, we show to prepare informative visualizations of the identified customer segments 
  to identify their characteristics profile.


### Course prerequisites

The course is aimed at business and data analysts who are familiar with working with tabular datasets (SQL, spreadsheets) and have at least beginner-level experience with the R programming language.
