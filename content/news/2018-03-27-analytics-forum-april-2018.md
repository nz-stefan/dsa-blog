##### Title

Web applications in R

##### Abstract

R Shiny is a web framework to rapidly develop data focused web applications and dashboards. It promises to enable data scientists to develop interactive data products on their own without requiring in-depth knowledge of HTML and Javascript. I have been working with Shiny for the last 3 years and would like to share my experience with the wider analytics community. I will be covering motivation of using R for data focused web applications, development, examples, data back-ends, deployment and security in an enterprise context.
