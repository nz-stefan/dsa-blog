## Raising the bar

Data Science Academy provides intensive, practical, hands-on courses to lift business intelligence skills to the next level. We engage New Zealandâ€™s top data science talent to up-skill and empower data professionals enabling them to deliver high quality data outputs, follow best practice and use modern data science tools in their daily work.

Improving the reliability and efficiency of the data processing workflow will establish credibility in data businesses, accelerate innovation and increase the confidence of both clients and analysts in the obtained analytical results. We embrace the scientific method. It is our mission to make data deliverables fully reproducible, decrease manual labor and consequently reduce errors and improve productivity of data professionals.

How are we different from other training providers? While many online courses lack practical hands-on sessions with experts and university courses can take a lot of time and commitment, we offer practical solutions for a very specific business problem. Your organization intends to build a churn model or a customer segmentation? We provide hands-on courses that teach exactly the required skills to fill such a business need. Course participants can put the learned concepts into action in their organisations immediately.
